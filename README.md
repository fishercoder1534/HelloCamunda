1. I created this as a new Maven project on Java11 by following this tutorial to learn Camunda: https://docs.camunda.org/get-started/quick-start/install/;
2. Run `mvn clean install` this project first before you attempt to run from Intellij as clicking on Maven refresh button in Intellij doesn't always work, it often hangs there, while `mvn clean install` usually finishes quickly and pull your needed dependencies somehow;
